# How does this work

![working case](https://github.com/Multi-Thinker/Homework-Assignment-1/blob/master/A1.gif?raw=true)

## Features
- The routes/handlers/root/segment works takign first route as parent like folders 
- GET or stream both request responses only get print when there is something to print
- added simple easy routing variable, adding indexes there can extend routes allow to make request
- routes are not case sensitive
- port can be changed through one global variable initiated on top
- Change port by ```PORT=PORT_NUMBER_HERE node file.js```
- the default port is 8080 if the new port contains non-numeric character
